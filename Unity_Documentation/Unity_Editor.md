# Unity Editor



1. **Default Layout**

* When you open a project, Unity displays a standard window layout.
* You can always restore it from **Window > Layouts > Default**.

2. **What is a Window in Unity**

* A window is a panel with a specific function.
* It can be docked or detached from the editor (like a normal operating system window).

3. **Main Windows**

* **Hierarchy**: List of all objects in the scene (e.g., Camera, Lights).
* **Scene View**: The view of the game world, where you can move and select objects.
* **Game View**: Shows what the camera sees, i.e., the "running" game.
* **Inspector**: Shows the properties and components of the selected object, allowing you to modify them.
* **Project Window**: Works like a file explorer, containing project folders, assets, and scenes.
* **Console**: Displays messages, errors, and debug information from the code or editor.

4. **Object Selection**

* You can select objects either from the **Hierarchy** or directly from the **Scene View** (by clicking on the icons: camera, sun, etc.).
* When you select an object, the **Scene View** and **Inspector** update to show you its information.

5. **Scenes and Folders**

* A **Scene** is like a game level.
* In the Project Window, you can create new folders, import assets, or open existing scenes.

In summary:
**Unity is organized into windows/panels**, each with a different purpose (managing objects, editing properties, exploring assets, viewing errors, etc.). Working with these windows in combination allows you to build and manage your game.
